## Abstract
Rotten Tomatillos is an app that allows users to browse through a collection of movie posters and vote for their favorite movies. Users can view a variety of movie posters, each linked to detailed movie information. By casting their votes, users contribute to ranking the movies based on popularity. 

## Set Up
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd rancid-tomatillos

4. Run your React app with `npm start`
5. App will run at `http://localhost:3000/`
6. Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop running the React app at any time
7. To run Cypress tests, use `npx cypress open`

## Technologies Used 
1. React: We used React and its JSX syntax to create a dynamic and responsive user interface, handling state and rendering components efficiently. JSX, which allows us to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, powers the appâ€™s key features such as displaying movie posters, filtering, and managing interactions with users. React's component-based structure helped organize the app, making it modular and easy to maintain.
2. Cypress: Used for testing the frontend. Cypress provides end-to-end testing capabilities to ensure the app behaves as expected. We used Cypress to simulate user interactions, test UI components, and verify that features like search and poster display work correctly.
3. HTML/CSS: We used HTML to structure our app and CSS to style it, ensuring that movie posters are displayed attractively and responsively. 
4. Netlify: We used Netlify to deploy the app. Netlify simplified deployment, handling the build process and serving the app efficiently. It also provides features like continuous deployment, which is great for quickly seeing changes made to the app.
